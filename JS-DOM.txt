DOM is used to interact with the elements of the web page.
It is basically a structured representation of HTML page.
DOM is tree structure.

Document is a special object that is the enrty point to the DOM. e.g document.querySelector();
This means query selector method is available on document object.
DOM is not a part of JS.
DOM methods and props are actually the part of Web APIs.

Any thing we get as an input from the user we get it as a string.

.querySelectorAll() method returns a node list.

querySelector methods require CSS selectors which are classes and id.

you can also add or remove CSS properties like classes by using .classList() method	

***********handling keyboard events
keyup: event will occur when the key is leave after press.
keydown: event will occur when the key is pressed
keypress: press and holding a key

keyboard events are global events that we listen on the whole document therefore we write:

//listening event on whole document instead on an element.
document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
  if (e.key == 'Escape') {
    modal.classList.add('hidden');
    overlay.classList.add('hidden'); 
  }
});

Here e is an event object which will be returned automatically when the event will occur. To see the info about the pressed key you can console.log(e) and object containing a lot of information will be returned.
