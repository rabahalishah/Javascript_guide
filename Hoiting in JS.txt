Hoiting means: Variables lifted at top of their scope.
BTS: Before execution the whole code is scanned and a new property for each new variable is created in variable environmental object.

functions are hoisted: Means we can use function declaration even before they are declared.
var variables are also hoisted: but if you will use var declaration even before they are declared you will get undefined. 				Its not very useful due to its weird behaviour.
let and const are not hoited (but techincally yes): if you will use var declaration even before they are declared you will 						    get uninitialized. Its not very useful due to its weird behaviour.

function expressins are NOT hoisted: Means we cannot use function expression even before they are declared.


variables created with var creates porperty in window object. Whereas let and const dont

************TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
This makes it easier to catch error: accessing variables before declaration is a bad practice and should be avoided.
it makes the variables to work as they are actually supposed to.
As const cannot re-assigned
