----------General Rules to have good code:
Use DRY principle (Do not repeat)
Do NOT pollute global namespace
Do NOT use var
Use strong type check (=== and !==)

------For Functions

functions should do only ONE thing.
Don't use more than 3 parameters
use default parameters whenever possible.
return same data type as received
use arrow functions when they make code more readable
Dont use arrow functions as methods as they do not have their own this keyword.


-------------Avoid Nested CODE:
use early returns (guard clauses)
Use ternary or logical operators (cause they do not create code block )instead of IF
use multiple if instead of if/ else-if
Avoid for loops instead use array methods
Avoid callback-based async APIs




-----------Async code

Consume promises with async  await for best readability
whenever possible run promises in parallel (promise.all)
Handle errors and promise rejections

-------Functional Programming
try to avoid data mutation
Use built in methods dont produce side effects
for data transformation use methods map, filter and reduce

-------Declarative syntax
Use array and object destructuring.
use spread operator (...)
use ternary (conditional) operator 
user template literals
